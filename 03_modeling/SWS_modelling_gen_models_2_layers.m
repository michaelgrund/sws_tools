function SWS_modelling_gen_models_2_layers(num_layers,dfreq)
%
% Systemcatic generation of theoretical SWS parameters for two and three layer models using equations 
% of Silver & Savage (1994) 
%
% Note: modified function MS_effective_splitting_N of MSAT toolbox (Walker & Wookey, 2012)
%       is needed to run the following code
%
% USE dominant frequency NOT period (so for 8 s use 0.125 as input for dfreq) !!! 
%
% single layer models are already included due to the parametrization,
% remove doublets at the end (TODO)
%
% PARFOR is used to parallelize process =>  speed up
% function parfor_progress(N) from matlab-exchange is NECESSARY if progress
% of calculation should be shown
