MATLAB tools for analyzing and plotting of shear wave splitting data

If you make use of the content in this repository please acknowledge my PhD thesis in whose framework several of the scripts and functions were developed:

- Grund, M. (2019), Exploring geodynamics at different depths with shear wave splitting, Dissertation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), https://doi.org/10.5445/IR/1000091425 

Content of the directories:

## 01_stereoplots
Generate stereoplots of splitting results based on output of SplitLab and StackSplit.

- color-code bars of splits with respect to backazimuth (see below for supported colormaps)
- shade full background or specific wedges

Supported colormaps 
  1) standard MATLAB colormaps: parula, winter, summer, copper....

  2) MatPlotLib 2.0 Colormaps: Perceptually Uniform and Beautiful
